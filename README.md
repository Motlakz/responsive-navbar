# Responsive Sidebar Implementation

## Steps that were taken:

- Created a hamburger menu button with a class of toggle so it can open the sidebar when triggered
- Added an additional button with a class of close so that it can close the sidebar when triggered
- Assigned variables to the classes that were intended for targeting purposes
- Triggered event listeners for the buttons to be toggled when activated on the website

## Future Intentions:

- Continue exploring and improving different ways to toggle a sidebar for either dashboards or websites.
